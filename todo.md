# Todo list for DoVue project
## High-priority  (Hotfixe issues and bug fixes needed)
- Fix the notes' multi router system.
- Implement the backend service away from firebase

## Low-priority  (Future features)
- Implement a Quote of the day section.
    - Too many people use todo list to write down todo items that they want to do but always procrastinate to do. Thus a Quote of the day is suggested to provide motivational quotes on every sign in to try and movtivate users to complete that todo lists.

## Others  (Misc. items to do once completed above todo lists)
