# Todo list for DoVue project
## High-priority  (Hotfixe issues and bug fixes needed)
- Add in a default page to show user while the App is loading
- Add a detector for user's internet status, pause the app when the user is offline for now before the P.W.A and local data usage system is built.
- Create a check to "kill" the app if firebase fails to init and add a notification item to signal firebase failure
- Fix the notes' multi router system.
- Implement the backend service away from firebase

## Low-priority  (Future features)
- Implement a Quote of the day section.
    - Too many people use todo list to write down todo items that they want to do but always procrastinate to do. Thus a Quote of the day is suggested to provide motivational quotes on every sign in to try and movtivate users to complete that todo lists.

## Others  (Misc. items to do once completed above todo lists)
