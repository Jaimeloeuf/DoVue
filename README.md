# DoVue
DoVue is a project to replace your current notes taking app, regardless if it is Google Keep or Microsoft OneNote.  
To provide our users with a Simple, Reliable and Beautiful note taking app, that just works, helping you to tackle whatever problem you have on hand.  
This is an open source project with a 3 Clause BSD license and a subscription version will be available too in the future that provides more value added features such as real-time sync and backups across all devices.  
You can refer to the todo.md file in project root to view items currently being worked on.
